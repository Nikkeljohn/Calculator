Contrast GuidelinesHeading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions, not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen renders

HTML page lang attribute has been Setaria properties have been implemented correctlyWCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followedManual tests were also performed to ensure the website was accessible as possible and an accessibility issue was identified.

Issue was found but resolved

HTML code validator showed no errors in every page

## Unfixed Bugs

* A warning appeared for one function as eval can be harmful.

## Deployment

### Version Control

The site was created using the Visual Studio code editor and pushed to github to the remote repository ‘tacos-travels’.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### Deployment to Github Pages

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the menu on left select 'Pages'
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Branch: main
  - Click 'Save'
  - A live link will be displayed in a green banner when published successfully. 

The live link can be found here -  https://nikkeljohn.github.io/Calculator/


### Clone the Repository Code Locally

Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to clone to use locally:

- Click on the code drop down button
- Click on HTTPS
- Copy the repository link to the clipboard
- Open your IDE of choice (git must be installed for the next steps)
- Type git clone copied-git-url into the IDE terminal

The project will now of been cloned on your local machine for use.
